# CodeToContent

> Turn real code into real content—automatically.

CodeToContent transforms your GitHub development activity into authentic, high-quality content for X, LinkedIn, and blogs using Gemini 3's long-context reasoning.

## The Problem

Developers create valuable technical progress daily, but most of that value dies inside GitHub. Turning commits, PRs, and architectural decisions into engaging content requires time and storytelling skills—skills many developers lack or can't consistently apply.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** - OAuth integration with your GitHub account
2. **Analyze** - Detects meaningful events (features, bug fixes, refactors, architectural changes)
3. **Extract** - Gemini 3 reasons over your code to understand intent, tradeoffs, and lessons learned
4. **Generate** - Creates platform-specific drafts for X threads, LinkedIn posts, and blog outlines

## Key Features

- **GitHub Integration** - Access commits, PRs, diffs, and comments
- **Smart Activity Detection** - Filters for high-signal development events
- **Insight Extraction** - Uses Gemini 3 to answer: What problem was solved? Why was this change necessary? What tradeoffs were made?
- **Multi-Platform Output** - Distinct tones for X, LinkedIn, and blogs, all grounded in the same facts

## Why Gemini 3?

Without Gemini 3's long-context reasoning, this product doesn't work. It enables:
- Analysis of full code diffs and PR history
- Reasoning over code evolution
- Extracting intent from raw code
- Synthesizing technical narratives

## Target Users

- Indie developers
- Solo founders
- Early-stage startup engineers

Anyone actively coding who wants visibility but dislikes content creation.

## Product Principle

> If the code didn't happen, the content shouldn't exist.

Every piece of content is anchored to real code and real decisions—no generic AI fluff.
